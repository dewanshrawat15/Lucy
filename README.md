A small utility app to scan QR Codes and barcodes. Just sign in with your Google account, and keep track of the history of your scanned items.

## Prerequisites
- Flutter installed on your machine
- An Android or iOS device
- An active internet connection
- An active Google account
- A firebase account to link the project to your firebase console

## Getting Started
It's easy to get started. Just plug in your device, link your account to your firebase console and then build the application.
To link the app to your firebase console, create a project, click the Android/iOS icon and follow the steps. After linking the Firebase Console, follow:
- If you use IDE's for flutter development
  - Connect your device
  - Build the application by the IDE you use for flutter development.
  - Or run ``` flutter run --release ``` on your console to build the app.
  - Click the camera button to open the Scanner and point and scan.
- If you use terminal or CMD for flutter development
  - Connect your device
  - Run ``` flutter run --release ``` on your console
  - Click the camera button to open the Scanner and point and scan.
- If you want to just build the apk
  - Run ``` flutter build apk --release ``` (for Android users)

PS, if you face any issues anywhere please feel free to open up a thread. I would love to help you out as soon as possible.
